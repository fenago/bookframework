## üìä Step 1: Avatar Research System

### The Foundation: Know Your Audience

Before writing a single word, you must understand your readers at a psychological level. This system creates 5 distinct avatars based on Eugene Schwartz's market awareness stages, ensuring your book speaks directly to your ideal readers.

### üéØ Avatar Research Prompt

```
You are an expert market researcher specializing in creating detailed customer avatars for educational and professional books. I need you to create 5 comprehensive avatars based on Eugene Schwartz's market awareness stages for my book on [YOUR BOOK TOPIC].

BOOK CONTEXT:
- Topic: [Describe your book's main subject]
- Target Audience: [Who you want to reach - profession, experience level, etc.]
- Price Point: $[X] - $[Y]
- Main Promise: [What transformation your book provides]

Please create detailed avatars for each awareness stage:

AVATAR 1: UNAWARE
- Doesn't know they have the problem your book solves
- Demographics, psychographics, lifestyle details
- Hidden pain points they don't recognize
- Language they use vs. avoid
- What would make them curious about your topic

AVATAR 2: PROBLEM AWARE (PRIMARY AVATAR)
- Knows they have the problem but not the solution
- Specific frustrations and failed attempts
- Emotional drivers and fears
- How they describe their challenges
- What evidence would convince them
- Include a "Dear Diary" emotional entry showing their internal struggle

AVATAR 3: SOLUTION AWARE  
- Knows solutions exist but not your specific approach
- What they've tried that hasn't worked
- Skepticism and objections to overcome
- Authority figures they trust
- What would differentiate your approach

AVATAR 4: PRODUCT AWARE
- Knows about your solution but needs convincing
- Specific objections to your approach
- Comparison shopping behavior
- What would tip them toward purchase

AVATAR 5: MOST AWARE
- Ready to buy, just needs the right offer
- What final concerns need addressing
- Urgency factors that motivate action

For each avatar, include:
- Detailed demographics and psychographics
- Specific language patterns and communication style
- Emotional drivers, fears, and desires
- Buying behavior and decision-making process
- Trust triggers and authority figures
- Success vision and transformation goals

Make the PRIMARY AVATAR (Problem Aware) the most detailed, as this is who the book primarily serves.
