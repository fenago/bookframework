### Avatar Deep-Dive Format (1000+ words each):

Take all of the output from the problem aware avatar above, and write me a diary entry from the perspective of that avatar.

Focus on their dominant negative emotions. Use visual words & writing, be visceral, be emotional, and be creative.

Write one entry for each scenario:

**Entry 1: Before Reading the Book**
