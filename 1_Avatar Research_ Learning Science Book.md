### "Dear Diary" Emotional Entry
*March 15th, 2024*

*I had another one of those moments today that makes me question everything I thought I knew about teaching. Maria turned in a paper that was clearly written by ChatGPT - the voice was completely different from her usual writing, and when I asked her about her thesis, she couldn't explain her own argument. But here's what's eating at me: the ideas in that paper were actually pretty good. Better than what she usually produces.*

*I'm so tired of feeling like I'm fighting a losing battle. Half my colleagues are pretending AI doesn't exist, and the other half are either panicking or diving in without any plan. Meanwhile, I'm stuck in the middle, knowing that this technology isn't going away but having no idea how to use it responsibly.*

*The worst part is that I can see the potential. When I played around with ChatGPT myself last week, I was amazed at how it could help me think through complex ideas. But then I watch my students use it as a shortcut to avoid thinking altogether, and I feel like I'm failing them. They're going to graduate into a world where AI is everywhere, and I'm not preparing them for that reality.*

*I keep thinking there has to be a way to embrace this technology that actually makes learning better, not easier. I want my students to be critical thinkers who can work WITH AI, not students who let AI do their thinking for them. But I feel like I'm figuring this out alone, and I'm terrified of making the wrong choices.*

*I need help. Not another webinar about "AI in education" that's either too technical or too superficial. I need someone who understands both the technology AND good teaching to show me how to do this right. My students deserve better than my current trial-and-error approach.*
